Our chapter has an unrivaled brotherhood, where every brother can be counted on to be there for every other brother through thick and thin. Our bond is strengthened by diverse activities that range from outdoor adventures and community service projects to intellectual discussions and social gatherings. If you are looking to make deep, lifelong connections, this is the home for you! In our brotherhood, you'll find a unique blend of support, growth, and shared experiences that forge unbreakable bonds.
In addition to competing together in intramurals we routinely play volleyball and basketball in our backyard court throughout the year. Furthermore, at the beginning of each Spring semester, the brotherhood takes a trip to a remote cabin to reflect upon the previous year of operations and discuss desired long-term changes in the fraternity, to keep our commitment towards lifelong learning and growth. To add some fun competition to the chapter, throughout each semester we compete in an in-house tournaments in various games (as individuals or teams) to crown winners.
