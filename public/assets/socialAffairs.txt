Each semester, we throw several large-scale and private parties at our house and in the largest party space on campus - our backyard. Some of our famous annual parties include Camo Party every fall, Tiki Tango every summer, end of semester parties, and our invite-only Christmas Party.
Aside from these larger events, each brother invites a date to events such as Wine & Cheese Night, Spaghetti Dinner, Karaoke events, and more. We also have out-of-town events - one weekend during the Fall Semester, the brotherhood drives down to Florida to enjoy the beautiful sandy beaches with their dates. In the Spring, we rent out a secluded lodge in the mountains where we relax, hang out, and explore the local city. 
Every home game brothers, alumni, and girls that sit in our section have fun and get ready to cheer on the jackets! To cap off the school year, in April, we invite a date to a city like New Orleans or Nashville, where we host an evening event, give out annual awards, and explore whatever city we end up in.
