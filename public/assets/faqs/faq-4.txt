What about hazing and safety?
From our national organization: too many lives have been cut short, shattered and derailed as a result of hazing. Delta Tau Delta continues to educate members and provide resources to empower members to prevent hazing.
“Hazing has no place within Delta Tau Delta,” said Jack Kreman, CEO of Delta Tau Delta Fraternity. “You have the power to ensure your chapter programming reflects a life of excellence.”
As a prominent chapter within our national organization, we pride ourselves on building bonds of brotherhood while ensuring that each and every member feels safe - members are not only encouraged but expected to respect each other's boundaries. We prioritize fostering a community within our chapter that is built upon the diverse group of excellent gentlemen that represent it. 
Our chapter holds the safety of guests and others on campus as a major priority. We recently collaborated with VOICE, the Wellness Empowerment Center at Georgia Tech, to establish the Greek VOICE Peer Educator (GVPE) program. This program trains representatives within Greek life to educate chapters and their respective members on topics like consent, safety, and treating guests and friends in and outside of the chapter with respect for their boundaries. We currently have one trained representative from our chapter as a GVPE who presents on such topics numerous times throughout the semester for new and existing members.
