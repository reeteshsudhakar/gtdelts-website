Why join a Georgia Tech Fraternity?
The Greek Life at Georgia Tech is continually honored to accept national Greek Affiliation awards each year. With such great Greek Life, it is no wonder that roughly 25% of all GT undergraduates are in a Greek organization.
The Greek freshman retention rate is annually higher than the non-Greek freshman retention rate meaning joining a Fraternity increases your chance of returning to Georgia Tech for your second year and every year afterwards.
The Greek graduation rate is also higher than the non-Greek graduation rate. That is the main goal of coming to Tech, to graduate with a great degree. Afterwards, the networking joining a Fraternity provides often can lead to a full time job right after college and thereafter.
While Greek alumni at Georgia Tech make up only 23% of Tech's alumni population, 48% of the major donors are Greek. What this shows is students who join a Fraternity are more satisfied with their undergraduate experience than those who do not join a Greek organization. That is a fact backed up by many national studies.
