What does the process of joining the Fraternity look like?
As you join Delta Tau Delta, you will become a new member through our formal pledging ceremony, which explains the obligations and values of living the life of a Delt. The overall new member program is filled with activities designed to help integrate each individual into the brotherhood and engage in activities that will help them grow personally, professionally, academically, and socially. Through our new member education program, prospective members can expect to learn the obligations, values, and history of the Fraternity at the chapter and national level. The culmination of this process is full membership within Delta Tau Delta.
