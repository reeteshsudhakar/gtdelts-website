While fraternities help serve as a social outlet for its members, Delta Tau Delta and our chapter strongly believe that a fraternity should provide foundations for its members to succeed throughout their lives. As such, a significant portion of that stems from academic and professional success. Our Member Development Board strives to provide the chapter and alumni with as many resources as possible. That includes study/review and tutoring sessions in the shelter and on campus, interview and career fair preparation, LinkedIn and resum√© reviews, and so much more. 

Our commitment to academic and professional success (whether through internships or post-graduation plans) is clear. Our chapter holds a significantly higher GPA than the average men's GPA at Georgia Tech (a 3.47/4.0). Most recently, our chapter GPA was a 3.61/4.0. Countless members pursue internships/co-ops, on-campus jobs, or research throughout the year.
