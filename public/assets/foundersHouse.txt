In this house, 8 Bethany College Students - William R. Cunningham, Alexander C. Earle, Richard H. Alfred, Henry K. Bell (top row, left to right), John C. Johnson, Jacob S. Lowe, Eugene Tarr, and John L.N. Hunt (bottom row, left to right) - Met in 1858 and founded Delta Tau Delta. This social fraternity soon spread across the American Continent. In 1977, plans were completed for the restoration of this structure to its original condition.
The birthplace of Delta Tau Delta has been preserved and stands today near the main gate of Bethany College, nestled in a quiet valley in the West Virginia hills.  Today it is known as The Bethany House or The Founders House. The two-story red brick house where the eight founders of Delta Tau Delta gathered in 1858 was formally restored in 1977. The house today appears as it did in 1858 when eight Bethany students met in the upstairs room to found a fraternity that would later span the continent.
