Delta Tau Delta established its national philanthropic partnership with JDRF in 2012. This partnership engages the Fraternityâ€™s more than 130 chapters and colonies on college campuses nationwide to work closely with local JDRF chapters to help raise funds and awareness of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Since the partnership began, Delta Tau Delta chapters have raised nearly $2 million for T1D research. Additionally, Delta Tau Delta undergraduates and alumni have contributed countless hours of service through local JDRF chapter events. The partnership between Delta Tau Delta and JDRF strives to create multiple avenues for philanthropy and creativity, from volunteering at JDRF galas and forming walk teams to creating campus fundraising and awareness events to benefit T1D research.
Our chapter actively participates in fundraising for JDRF, on and off campus (in the Greater Atlanta area). Members engage in the Georgia and South Carolina chapter's programming to raise funds for the national organization, as well as programming devised by our Philanthropy Chairman to raise funds on campus. Some examples of successful events have been a Trivia Night (hosted in the chapter house), Pelt-a-Delt (pelting brothers with pies and balloons), and Delt Donuts (selling Krispy Kreme donuts in the center of campus). Our chapter regularly raises thousands of dollars for JDRF annually to support their cause. 
We also partner with various charitable organizations around campus to support the local community - two such prominent organizations are Trees Atlanta and the Bashor Homeless Men's Shelter. Our brothers have planted 100+ trees in various communities around Georgia Tech, removed invasive species in local forests and parks, and completed overnight shifts in shelters to support those in need.
