Welcome to our website! Here, you can learn more about the Georgia Tech chapter of Delta Tau Delta, Gamma Psi, and our brotherhood. 

Why join a fraternity at all? Fraternities are values-based organizations which offer young men many challenges and opportunities that a traditional college education may not afford. Through leadership opportunities within a fraternity, a young man may gain leadership skills valuable long after graduation. A member of a fraternity has an immediate support group that will become life-long network of friends. Joining a fraternity is more than just something you do in college. It is a commitment and benefit for a lifetime.

Delta Tau Delta provides a Greek Life experience that is rooted in four fundamental principles: Truth, Courage, Faith, and Power. Our fraternity was established on values that continue to guide us to this day. Our fraternity prides itself on being able to offer a balanced college life, engaging our brothers socially, academically, professionally, and more. Our members are constantly engaged in a variety of on- and off-campus extracurriculars and enriching activities. A consistent award-winning Delt chapter, Gamma Psi equips brothers to grow as individuals while introducing them to a network of lifelong brothers, near and far.
