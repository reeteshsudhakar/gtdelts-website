Delta Tau Delta offers a diverse, well-rounded fraternity experience that you cannot find elsewhere. Our brotherhood spans members from across the nation, and even on an international level. The members of our brotherhood are involved in various organizations across campus, excel in their lives on- and off-campus, and continue to pursue successful careers post-graduation across countless industries. We also offer various social and brotherhood events on-campus in our wonderful property (the second largest on campus) and across the Southern region. We are avid supporters of our local community, parterning with JDRF, Trees Atlanta, and other charitable organizations to support their operations. 
From social events to brotherhood programming to volunteering, you can always find Delts engaged. Members of our chapter also regularly travel to various destinations together across the world - we've had brothers proudly hold the Delt flag in the Dominican Republic, across the United States, and even at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro! No matter the scenario, you can always find a brother to meet up with.
